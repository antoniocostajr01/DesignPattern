# DesignPattern

A collection of classic software design patterns implemented in Swift.  
This repository is intended to help developers learn, explore, and apply well-known patterns in real Swift applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software architecture.  
They help make your code more maintainable, flexible, and scalable.  
This project demonstrates each pattern with clear and simple Swift implementations, often using real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ§± Implemented Patterns

### Creational
- **Singleton** â€“ Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method** â€“ Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
- **Builder** â€“ Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **Prototype** â€“ Clones existing objects without coupling to their specific classes.

### Structural
- **Adapter** â€“ Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Decorator** â€“ Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Facade** â€“ Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Composite** â€“ Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.

### Behavioral
- **Observer** â€“ Notifies objects about state changes in other objects.
- **Strategy** â€“ Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
- **Command** â€“ Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Chain of Responsibility** â€“ Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
